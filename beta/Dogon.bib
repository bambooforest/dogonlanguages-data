A summary of William J. Samarin's (1969) account of Gbaya insults attests their linkage to a specific linguistic structure with unique semantic & syntactic components; as similar descriptions are unavailable for other African languages, a corpus of 400 insults in Kasim (Gurunsi, Burkina Faso) is analyzed. Seven syntactic structures are found, of which one accounts for 62 percent of the data: possessive pronoun + noun + ideophone + comparison. All but one of the structures is characterized by the absence of a verbal predicate, copulative or otherwise. J. Hitchcock},

	Abstract = {Logophoricity in Donno S(open o), a Dogon language spoken in Mali & Burkina Faso, is examined as it relates primarily to pronouns. Logophoric pronouns (LPs) are defined as "referring to the person whose words, thoughts, or state of mind are being reported," & are examined for environments in which they occur. Analysis of the Donno S(open o) LP inyem(epsilon) shows that it is restricted in terms of person (third) & number (singular), but not in terms of part of speech, ie, it can occur as subject, direct or indirect object, oblique, or possessor; it can also occur in the periphrastic reflexive. Examples illustrate that the LP can occur anywhere in indirect discourse. At the sentence level, LPs in Donno S(open o) are licensed by two main classes of predicates (speech & thought) & by two peripheral constructions ("in order to" & benefactive). The interactions of logophoricity in Donno S(open o) with the morphological aspects of complementizers, verbal inflection for subject - verb agreement, & subject marking are each considered, & comparisons are made with other languages in which logophoricity occurs. 1 Table, 12 References.

In contrast to indirect reflexives in English, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, & Latin, some African languages (eg, Dogon, Ewe, Tupuri) contain morphologically distinct logophoric pronouns that cannot be defined in terms of binding conditions, but are simply a type of indirect discourse form & only represent point of view when they are not licensed by a predicate. It is demonstrated that these pronouns are similar to indirect reflexives in that (1) when the logophoric pronoun is obligatory, it does not represent point of view, (2) when a logophoric pronoun indicates the point of view of the internal protagonist, the use of a personal pronoun indicates a point of view other than that of the internal protagonist, & (3) some logophoric pronouns & indirect reflexives are always obligatory, & thus never represent point of view. 33 References.

The verbs in this class have different derivational histories; they also have various types of meaning (middle, middle - related, non - middle). Although C3 verbs cannot be unified derivationally or semantically, they can all be defined both paradigmatically & in terms of phonotactic constraints, like the other two verb classes in Donno So. Comparison with other Dogon languages shows how the middle evolved in Dogon & how Donno So C3 verbs in turn evolved from the middle. These results expand Kemmer's (1993) discussion of the processes involved in the evolution of middle systems. The comparison also provides some hypotheses about the history of Dogon. 24 References.

This type of case marking distinguishes two forms, topic/actor (unmarked) vs. focus/patient (marked): the latter encodes focal S & P participants, as well as topical Ps if A & P are not otherwise discriminated. This system (attested in Yukaghir & Dogon) involves a conspicuous markedness paradox: the least frequent constellation of parameters, A - focus, remains unmarked. The emergence of such systems is accounted for in terms of default role interpretation of NPs, guided by correlations between semantic & information - structure roles, whereby a focus marker acquires the P - marking function. If this analysis is formalized in terms of Bidirectional Optimality Theory, the markedness paradox of focus - oriented splits proves to instantiate the more general phenomenon of emergence of the unmarked.

The macro classification is based on the method of resemblances, with refining based on lexicostatistics paired with the examination of shared innovations. The comparative method has mostly been applied at a micro level to specific subgroups. A comprehensive reconstruction of Niger - Congo, including the establishment of sound laws, remains the major future task. 1 Figure, 56 References. Adapted from the source document},

Finally, recent attempts in ethnosemantics & folk definition analyses are criticized along the same Quinian lines. An alternative approach & model in semantic study is introduced, called "constitutive analysis." An attempt is made to build an a posteriori semantic model, having the consultants of the cultural community decide on relevance, basicness of derivedness, & actual depth & width of semantic representations at any level. Concrete empirical material on spatial representation (the semantics of space) is drawn from the Dogon of Mali. Final conclusions note the possibility of a generalization of a nonanalytic analysis, however, stressing the meaning - aspect (rather than mere reference in Quinian sense). AA},

	Abstract = {The grammatical status of resultative verbal structures is examined to determine whether the resultativity/nonresultativity opposition can be grammaticalized. The possibility that such a grammaticalization may be reflected in a verb's semantic content is explored & answered in the affirmative. Literature & definitions of the resultative are surveyed. The thesis that the resultative may describe only natural results is contested & supported with evidence from Dogon (Niger - Kongo), where resultatives do not obligatorily describe natural results, & yet the resultative/nonresultative opposition has a grammatical character. 20 References.
